<p>
  Welcome to Berkeley High’s <i>Intro to Programming</i> class.
</p>

<p>
  This website consists of a number of tools you will use to do some of your
  first assignments for this class. We’ll go over getting set up in the
  first day or two of class but the main thing you need to do
  is <a href="https://github.com/signup">sign up for a free GitHub
    account</a> if you don’t already have one. (If you already have a GitHub
  account, it’s probably easiest to use that one for this class but if you’d
  rather create a new account for class that’s fine too.)
</p>

<p>
  If you've set up your GitHub account you can look at the tools here. Or if
  you haven't you can still play with them but you won't be able to save
  your work.
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/assignments/simple-draw">Simple drawing environment</a></li>
    <li><a href="/demo/repl/">Play with a REPL</a></li>
    <li><a href="/assignments/bouncing-ball">Bouncing ball</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h1>Help center</h1>

<p>Another tool we’ll be using this year
is <a href="https://help.gigamonkeys.com">BHS CS Classroom Help</a> which we’ll
use to coordinate getting help during class and also where you’ll keep a journal
of your progress in this class.</p>

<h1>Class policies</h1>

<p>Nothing too onerous and we’ll go over them in class but I do have a
few <a href="/policy/">classroom policies</a>.

<h1>Expression problem sets</h1>

<p>As a warm-up before writing full programs, these problem sets are for
practicing writing expressions that evaluate to certain values.</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    {%- for set in collections.expressions -%}
    <li><a href="{{set.url}}">{{ set.data.title }}</a></li>
    {%- endfor -%}
  </ul>
</p>

<h1>Class calendar</h1>

<p>
  I also have a tentative <a href="calendar/">class calendar</a>. Obviously as
  this is the first year of this course I expect that I’ll have to make
  adjustments along the way as I see how long different topics actually take.
  I’m also still working on this and probably will be up until the first day of
  school.
</p>

<h1>Slides</h1>

<p>
  I haven’t made a bunch of slides yet but as I do, I’ll add them here. Note,
  they probably won’t make a ton of sense without me talking over them. So come
  to class. Or hope I make a video.
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    {%- for deck in collections.slides -%}
    <li><a href="{{deck.url}}">{{ deck.data.title }}</a></li>
    {%- endfor -%}
  </ul>
</p>

<h1>Games</h1>

<p>
  Finally, some games. Don't expect wildly immersive game play but these will
  give you a quick way to make sure you have certain fundamental bits of
  knowledge solid.
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/games/values/">Values</a>
    <li><a href="/games/holes/">Fill the hole</a>
    <li><a href="/games/bingo/">Boolean bingo</a>
  </ul>
</p>
