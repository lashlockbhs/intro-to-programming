- Unit: Getting started with Javascript (7 weeks)

  - Intro to Intro (1)

    - Introductions

      - Me to you

      - You to me. Index card with:

        - Preferred name on one side in big letters

        - Answers to questions on the board on the other side.

          - Why are you taking this class?

          - What do hope to learn?

          - Do you have any prior experience programming? If so describe briefly.

          - Where did you go to middle school?

          - Pronouns if you don't want me to guess

        - When you're done, put the card name side up on your desk.

    - Class policies

      - No phones out during class. First-come, first-served access to 10 slots
        in the Phone Spa. All other phones must stay in pocket or bag during
        class or will be taken and not charged.

      - No games and no social media. Computer is for doing work and research
        related to your work.

      - Grades:

        - Portfolio (60%)

          - The collection of all the code you wrote over the year.

          - You will have an opportunity at the end of the year to go back and
            work on earlier projects

          - You will also get to pick a small number of programs as the best
            representation of your work.

        - Journal (20%)

          - Daily journal of what you worked on, what problems you ran into, and
            how you got unstuck.

        - Collaboration and dilligence (20%)

          - Being a helpful partner and teammate

          - Being on task

          - Lose points by being disruptive to others.

      - Homework:

        - Very little. Maybe sometimes some reading or watching a brief video.
          You can work on your programs outside of class but it should not be
          necessary.

      - Recurse Center rules. https://www.recurse.com/social-rules

      - Coding, open source, and working together:

        - Write your own code. (When pairing, pair turns in the same code.)

        - If you find useful snippets of code on the internet, cite it in a comment.

    - What is programming?

      - Why is it fun?

      - Why is it hard?

        - There are a lot of details that you have to get right.

        - It is very abstract.

        - Those two things are usually at the opposite end of the mental spectrum.
